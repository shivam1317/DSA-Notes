## Problem statement:

>Given an array containing **N** integers and a positive integer **K**, find the length of the longest sub array with sum of the elements divisible by the given value **K**.

## Example:

**Input:**
```
A[] = {2, 7, 6, 1, 4, 5}
K = 3
```
**Output:** 
```
4
```
**Explanation:**
```
The subarray is {7, 6, 1, 4}
with sum 18, which is divisible by 3.
```

## Approach:

--> Here the question looks like we have to use ==sliding window method== But here we need maximum length of subarray so this method will take `O(n^2)` which is not good.

So after that i calculated ==prefix sum== for all the elements and it looks like this:

```
Arr[] = [2,7,6,1,4,5]
Prefix[] = [2,9,15,16,20,25]
```

we can't also do sliding window in `prefix[]` because ig it will not help.

So then i calculated remainders for all prefix sum and it looks like this:

```
Prefix[] = [2,9,15,16,20,25]
Remainder = [2,0,0,1,2,1]
```

--> Here we can see if we take the length between ==2 same remainders== then it will be the subarray with sum divisible by K. so now we just have to count longest length.

--> Now one more problem is that if we have negative numbers then remainder will be negative too. So to handle that we will ==add k into that to make it positive==

We will use `unordered_map` to store the remainders.

At last we will return the longest subarray length.

## Code

```cpp
int longSubarrWthSumDivByK(int arr[], int n, int k)
	{
	    int sum = 0;
	    int ans = 0;
	    unordered_map<int,int>mp;
	    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
	        sum += arr[i]; // Finding prefix sum
	        int r = sum % k; // Finding remainder
	        if(r < 0){ // If remainder is negative then add k into it
	            r += k;
	        }
	        if(r == 0){ // If remainder is 0 means the current sum is divisible by k so take the length which we can get with i+1 and update with ans.
	            ans = max(ans,i+1);
	        }
			// Find the remainder in map and if it's already present then take the distance between the previous remainder's index and current index to find length.
	        else if(mp.find(r) != mp.end()){
	            ans = max(ans,i-mp[r]);
			// else add the remainder in map with it's index.
	        }else{
	            mp[r] = i;
	        }
	    }
	
	    return ans;
	}
```
